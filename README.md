# My portfolio, created for [andrewborstein.com](http://andrewborstein.com)

Tools used to build this website (in 2015, with only minor content updates since):
- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) - you can host any static website (HTML, CSS, JS) really easily using GitHub, totally for free!
- [Materialize](https://materializecss.com) - a super handy CSS framework to get Google's Material Design components and style
- [Jade](http://jade-lang.com/) - a templating language that helps create reusable HTML markup
- [Grunt](https://gruntjs.com/) - a JS task runner to compile my jade files into actual HTML
- And a bunch of custom CSS to get it looking just right.
